## **<p>Business Activities:</p>**  

### **<p>What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?</p>**  

Opendoor Labs Inc. is a Real Estate Technology Company that has Pioneered A New Home-Buying Model, by streamlining the purchasing and selling process for residential properties in America.  

Customers interested in selling their home can go to Opendoor, and if their home meets Opendoor’s criteria, Opendoor will provide an offer price sight unseen after gathering information about the home from the customer. Against the offer price, the company will charge home sellers a risk fee to hedge against any potential depreciation in home price.  

This buying model is attractive to sellers because it allows them to sell their homes immediately. They purchase a home directly from a homeowner, improve it, and list it on the market as fast as possible.  

Opendoor Labs Inc. also streamlines the home buying process.  

Home buyers interested in properties available via OpenDoor can access and view properties at their convenience with key codes and without agents. What’s more, home buyers are provided a 30-day guarantee on their purchase, which stipulates that Opendoor will buy back the home.  

Existing and new customers can take advantage of home trade-ins as well, purchasing a home directly from interested home buyers and avoiding the cost of carrying two mortgages at once or making offers contingent on selling a home. ***6***  

### **<p>Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?</p>**

It helps sellers to receive an offer without listing or showing their home and buyers to browse for homes on sale and instantly unlock them using the company's application that enables customers to buy and sell properties in a hassle-free way. ***3***
